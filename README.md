# üåå Azure Cosmos DB Bulk Operation CLI Tool

Custom CLI tool, written in `C#`, for bulk updating/inserting & deleting Azure Cosmos Database records. It leverages the Azure Cosmos DB SDK, Bulk Executor context, Patch API and other performant configurations. It aims to serve as a showcase of best practices for working with the SDK for throughput performant workloads. 

Motivation behind this project was the lack of a simple way of mutating a lot of records. Microsoft don't support
common create/update/delete operations with a SQL like syntax, so you're pretty much left with the Cosmos SDK, stored procedures (which have their own limitations and caveats) or the [Azure Cosmos DB Desktop Data Migration Tool](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/data-migration-desktop-tool) which can be extended with custom extensions.

The tool can be extended with custom strategies and utilized for real production scenarios.

‚ö†Ô∏è When running the tool against an actual resource (PROD or NON-PROD) make sure that you run the `Release` build in order to utilize local query plan generation & all of the other performance optimizations by the SDK. Do not change the platform target away from `x64`. The SQL SDK includes a native ServiceInterop.dll to parse and optimize queries locally. ServiceInterop.dll is supported only on the Windows x64 platform.

## üß©Prerequisites

### üå†Emulator
In case you want to try this tool in an isolated environment you will need to spin up an instance of the `Azure Cosmos Emulator`.
The instructions below are for a containerized instance of it, but `Microsoft` provide a native Windows installation, which you can find [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-release-notes).

```bash
# Start a podman/docker container with the Azure Cosmos Emulator image.
podman run -p 4387:8081 -p 10250-10255:10250-10255 --name azcdb -d mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest

# SSH into the machine and download the emulator's development certificate to the CA store.
podman machine ssh
sudo curl -k -o /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/azcdb-emulator.pem https://localhost:4387/_explorer/emulator.pem

# Add the certificates to the list of trusted CAs.
sudo update-ca-trust
```
üí° The certificate stores can differ in other linux distributions, the example above is for `RHEL` based distros.

After you've spin up the container & trusted the development SSL cert, navigate to https://localhost:4387/_explorer/index.html in order to verify that the emulator is up and running.

## üîß Configuration
The important configuration keys are part of the `appsettings.json` file (connection strings, container settings, logging)
The app also supports a couple of CLI parameters:
```powershell
.\Cosmos.BulkOperation.CLI.exe --help
Cosmos.BulkOperation.CLI 1.0.0+9ca8b955b780245b05b331336bcce77a240f1285

  --dry-run    (Default: false) Dry-run mode, allowing for changes to be scheduled, but not evaluated on the destination Cosmos database. Used for debugging.

  --help       Display this help screen.

  --version    Display version information.
```

## üóíÔ∏è Logs
Logs are rolled on a daily basis by default on the following path: `"%USERPROFILE%\bulk-operation-cli-tool-log-{date stamp}.txt`. You can configure that path in the `appsettings.json` file.

## üîÅ Retry policy
By default all Cosmos DB operations in this tool are wrapped around a fallback exponential retry policy. The default timespan intervals (in seconds) are: `2, 4, 8, 16 & 32`. Before kicking off those custom policies, the SDK is configured to automatically retry any throttled requests (by default 25 times).
